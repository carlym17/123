Hello, I'm Carly
I live on (or in! Depending on who you’re talking to) Long Island with my husband, 2 girls- Oliva & Ruby, and my dog- Frank. 
I love hanging out with my kids and trying new places to eat. 
I have 10+ years experience in the Martech/Big Data Space and look forward to meeting the Vercel team!
